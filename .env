# Solana gRPC Endpoint Configuration
# 
# 💡 TIP: Use your own gRPC endpoint in this file for faster response!
#    The default free endpoint is provided below, but using your own endpoint
#    will give you better performance and reliability.
#
# If you want to use the free default endpoint, use these values:
GRPC_ENDPOINT=https://solana-rpc.parafi.tech:10443
X_TOKEN=10443
#
# Or provide your own custom endpoint and token for faster response:
# GRPC_ENDPOINT=https://your-custom-endpoint.com:443
# X_TOKEN=your-custom-token
